#### ------------ Part 1 ------------

##### #### Description ####

Design Minds interactive zine is an interactive zine that explores what is design minds from a designer's perspective. Design minds is what designer think while doing their work. 

[Purpose]  I made this zine interactive to showcase how I define design minds after five years of design training and practice. It has 20 pages, each page has one sentence. 

[How it's engaging]  User can have fun while reading this interactive zine by clicking or moving the mouse. Each page is playful. Compared with traditional zine that I printed out, design minds interactive zine is more easy to share and deliver to other people from afar. 

[Tagtet user]   Anyone who's interested in design thinking and would like to read an interactive zine on this topic.

- p2: move the mouse from left to right to see two parts combine together and form a shape
- p3: move the mouse from left to right to change the size of "theoretically and practically" component
- p4: see the daily hardware/softwares that designer use roaming around the webpage like bounding ball
- p5: move the mouse from left to right to see the brain growing bigger
- p6: see the widgets roaming around the webpage like bounding ball
- p7: see "thinking" component blink on the page
- p8: move the mouse from left to right to see the muscle grow bigger
- p9: move the mouse above the gas animation to make it move faster
- p10: see the component swing around
- p11: move the mouse around to see the eyes moving to the direction of the mouse
- p12: move the mouse from left to right to see each cycle appear at the top right

###### External Libraries ###### 
1. p5.js library: I used this library for the animation and all the interactions part. The components are also imported with js file, which uses the p5.js library.

2. bootstrap library: I used this library for the html appearance. This library has great button that I can use immediately. It's fast and easy to implement good-looking button and text without much effort.

These two libraries makes my website interactive and good-looking with less efforts than vanilla javascript.

###### Modifications ###### 

1. Slicing each component inside the figma file
1. Fine-tuned the ways of interaction in each page

### ------------ Part 5 ------------


###### Major challenges ###### 
1. Slicing the components in sketch software: I have to make all the png file's background as white as possible. Slicing each component out and organizing it in a great order also takes a lot of time.

2. Learning the p5.js: It is a library mainly for artists. It has many new features and syntax compared with javascript, like pop(), push(), mouseX, mouseY, etc. I learnt this with examples on the website and also the tutorials by Daniel Shiffman on youtube.

3. Fine-tuning each interactive widget: In each page, I fine-tuned the way user interact with the page. The way each widget move, and how fast it should move/ where it moves should suit that scenario and common sense, which takes time.
